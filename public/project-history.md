# Project History: Dental Chamber Portal

This document provides a summary of the features and changes implemented in this project, in chronological order.

## 1. Initial Project Setup

- **Framework**: Initialized a Next.js 15 application with the App Router.
- **Language**: Set up with TypeScript for robust type-safety.
- **Styling**:
    - Integrated Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling.
    - Added ShadCN UI for a comprehensive, accessible component library.
    - Configured custom fonts (`Inter` and `Space Grotesk`) and a professional color palette.
- **Backend**: Configured Firebase (Firestore, Authentication, Storage) for backend services.

## 2. Authentication and User Registration

- **Multi-Step Registration**: Implemented a comprehensive 6-step registration flow for new dentists:
    1.  Email & Account Creation
    2.  Password Setup
    3.  Personal Data Collection
    4.  Professional Qualifications & Document Upload
    5.  Practice Information
    6.  Final Review & Submission
- **Login System**: Developed a secure login page with email and password authentication.
- **Authentication Context**: Created a global `AuthContext` to manage user state, roles, and authentication status throughout the application.
- **User Roles**: Established a role-based access control system with initial roles for `dentist` and `lk_member` (State Chamber Member).

## 3. Internationalization (i18n)

- **Locale Support**: Added support for English (`en`) and German (`de`) using JSON translation files.
- **Routing**: Implemented Next.js middleware to handle locale-based routing (e.g., `/en/dashboard`, `/de/dashboard`).
- **Language Switcher**: Created a dynamic language switcher component allowing users to change their preferred language on the fly.

## 4. Core Application Features

- **Role-Based Dashboards**:
    - **Dentist Dashboard**: Displays dynamic summaries for training points and confirmed representation hours, fetched from Firestore. Includes mock data for confirming representation requests.
    - **LK Member Dashboard**: Shows a list of new member registrations that are pending review.
- **Member Management (LK Member)**:
    - **Member Overview**: A page listing all registered members with their status, points, and other key details.
    - **Member Review System**: A dedicated workflow for LK members to view a pending applicant's full data submission (including uploaded documents) and either `approve` or `reject` the registration.
- **Document Management**:
    - A central page for viewing document templates, guidelines, and recommendations.
    - Added functionality for LK members to upload new documents and delete existing ones.
- **Settings Page**:
    - Allows authenticated users to view and update their personal, professional, and practice information.
    - Implemented a secure "Delete Account" feature with a confirmation dialog.
    - **Pending User State**: Users awaiting approval can access the settings page to review, edit, or delete their submitted information.

## 5. UI/UX and Theming

- **Dark Mode**:
    - Integrated `next-themes` to provide light, dark, and system theme options.
    - Implemented a custom dark mode theme based on the Dracula color palette.
    - Added a theme toggle button to the main application header and the authentication layout.
- **Layout Enhancements**:
    - Refined the layout of the login page to use a three-column grid for better organization.
    - Adjusted the Dentist Dashboard layout to a two-column format for improved readability.
- **Component Design**: Leveraged ShadCN components consistently for a modern, accessible, and cohesive user interface.

## 6. Developer Experience and Tooling

- **Developer Module**:
    - Created a dedicated page for development and testing purposes.
    - **Database Seeding**: Added server actions and buttons to populate Firestore with initial data for training categories, organizers, user training history, and state chambers.
    - **User State Testing**: Implemented a tool to set a specific user's status to `pending` to facilitate testing of the review and approval flows.
- **Project History**: This file was created to provide a clear and concise summary of the project's evolution.

## 7. AI Integration

- **Genkit Setup**: Integrated Google's Genkit as the AI framework.
- **Smart Document Suggestions**: Created an AI flow (`suggestDocuments`) that analyzes a user's role and region to provide a list of relevant document recommendations on their dashboard.

## 8. Bug Fixes and Refinements

- **Hydration Errors**: Resolved multiple Next.js hydration errors by correctly handling client-side data fetching (e.g., loading translation files within `useEffect`).
- **Runtime Errors**: Fixed various bugs, including a `cn is not defined` error caused by a missing import.
- **Best Practices**: Updated code to align with the latest Next.js conventions, such as using the `useParams` hook instead of directly accessing the `params` prop in client components.
- **Navigation Logic**: Improved sidebar navigation to ensure disabled links are fully inert for users in a pending state.
