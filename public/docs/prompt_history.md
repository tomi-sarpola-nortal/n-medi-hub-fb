# Prompt & Response History

This document contains a detailed, synthesized log of the user prompts and AI responses that led to the creation of the Dental Chamber Portal application.

### Session 1: Initial Layout and Navigation

**User:**
> Can you set up the initial layout for the app? I need a sidebar for navigation and a main content area with a header.

**AI:**
> I've created the basic layout components. You now have an `AppLayout` component that includes a `Header` and a `Sidebar`. The sidebar is configured with placeholder navigation items. I also set up the basic routing structure.

### Session 2: Firebase and Authentication Setup

**User:**
> Let's integrate Firebase and set up the authentication flow. I need a login page and a way to manage user sessions.

**AI:**
> I've configured Firebase in the project and created an `AuthContext` to manage the user's session state. A `LoginPage` has been created with email/password fields, and the `useAuth` hook now provides login and logout functionality.

### Session 3: Multi-Step Registration Workflow

**User:**
> I need a comprehensive, multi-step registration process for new dentists. It should guide them through collecting personal data, professional qualifications, and practice information, including document uploads.

**AI:**
> I have implemented the full multi-step registration workflow. It consists of six distinct steps, from account creation to final review. I've also integrated file uploads for required documents using Firebase Storage and implemented a client-side store to retain form data between steps. The flow concludes with a success page and creates a new user record with a 'pending' status.

### Session 4: Role-Based Dashboards

**User:**
> Now that users can register, we need dashboards tailored to their roles. Create separate dashboard views for 'dentist' and 'lk_member'.

**AI:**
> I've created two new dashboard components: `DentistDashboard` and `LkMemberDashboard`. The main dashboard page now dynamically renders the correct component based on the logged-in user's role. The dentist view shows training and representation summaries, while the chamber member view focuses on pending member reviews.

### Session 5: Building Core Application Pages

**User:**
> Let's build out the main application pages: Education/Trainings for dentists, and a Member Overview with a detail/review flow for chamber members.

**AI:**
> I have created the requested pages.
> - The `/education` page now fetches and displays a dentist's training history and progress.
> - The `/member-overview` page provides a searchable list of all members for the `lk_member` role.
> - Clicking a member opens a detailed profile page (`/member-overview/[memberId]`).
> - From the detail page, a chamber member can access a review page (`/member-overview/[memberId]/review`) to approve or reject pending applications.

### Session 6: "My Representations" Module & Refinements

**User:**
> The "My Representations" page needs to be improved. Can we split the table into "received" and "performed" representations? Also, add a better way to select a dentist when creating a new representation instead of a simple dropdown.

**AI:**
> I have refactored the "My Representations" page into two distinct tables for clarity. For creating a new representation, I've replaced the dropdown with a pop-up dialog that allows you to search for dentists by name or ID. I've also added a "Previously Represented" card to the page, which provides a quick-select list of dentists you've recently worked with to speed up the process.

### Session 7: Final UI/UX Polish & Documentation

**User:**
> Let's make a few UI fixes. Change the user profile image to a standard icon and fix the text wrapping on the "Your State Chamber" dashboard card. Also, add search to the documents page.

**AI:**
> I have implemented the requested UI refinements. The sidebar now uses a standard `UserCircle` icon for the user profile, the text on the dashboard card wraps correctly, and the "Document Templates" page now includes a search bar to filter by title or publisher.

**User:**
> Can you create a summary of the features and changes implemented in this project and save it to a file?

**AI:**
> I have created a `project-history.md` file summarizing our work and placed it in the `/public/docs` directory. I've also added a "Developer Module" page with a button that links to this document for easy access.

**User:**
> Can you also create a detailed log of our prompts and responses?

**AI:**
> I have created this `prompt_history.md` file to document our session. I've also added a button to the Developer Module page that links directly to this file.
