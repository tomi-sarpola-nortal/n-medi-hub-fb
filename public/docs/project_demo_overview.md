# Project Demo Overview: Firebase Studio and ÖZÄK Web Application

## 1. Introduction and Project Context

This document provides an overview of our ongoing project to develop a web application for the **Austrian Dentist Chamber (ÖZÄK)** using **Firebase Studio**.

**Meeting Invite Summary:**
- **Purpose:** Review of Firebase Studio project status.
- **Kick-off Date:** June 4th (with Skunkworks AI project participants).
- **Project Goal:** To evaluate if Firebase Studio can significantly increase profit, shorten development time, and reduce overall cost to a competitive level for a project initially estimated at 310 man-working-days.

## 2. Our Development Process with Firebase Studio

Our process began with in-depth learning of Firebase features and the creation of early prototypes to understand the platform's capabilities.

- **Prototyping & Evaluation:** We developed 13 distinct projects to evaluate various aspects, including front-end, UI stack, and back-end functionalities.
- **Current Development Environment:** This specific project, which serves as our primary development environment, is **front-end version 6**.
- **Staging & Production Strategy:** Our recommendation for handling staging and production environments is to replicate the development workspace to new project workspaces via GitHub, and then configure Firebase Application Hosting for these separate environments.
- **Feature Scope:** The customer provided 31 distinct feature requirements, encompassing critical functionalities such as:
    - Authorization and Role-Based Database Access
    - Comprehensive User Interfaces
    - Action Dashboards
    - Appointment Bookings
    - Training History Management
    - Activity KPIs
    - Robust Audit Logging
    - An API for connecting to additional user information
- **Development Approach Evaluation:** We explored various development methodologies, including importing designs from Figma, generating apps from plain verbal descriptions, and using a combination of Figma images with verbal descriptions. Our findings recommend the **Figma image combined with verbal description** as the most effective starting point.
- **Reproducing Our Process:** Developers can replicate our successful workflow by following these steps:
    1. Create a new project in [Firebase Studio](https://studio.firebase.google.com/).
    2. Provide the initial prompt and the Figma image from "Onenote Prompt for V6".
    3. Review and update the prototyper plan documented in "Onenote Prototyper plan for V6".
    4. Review and compare the generated output against "Onenote Prototyper output V6".
    5. Extract and refine requirements from the "WBS ÖZÄK 2.xlsx" project file.
    6. Integrate additional design elements from the Figma URL: https://www.figma.com/design/M0wUpnRCI9QIi03ayJ9e81/%C3%96Z%C3%84K-Proposal.

## 3. Project Status

After approximately **two weeks of dedicated work**, the application is currently **60% complete**.

## 4. Findings and Recommendations

Our experience with Firebase Studio's prototyper has yielded significant insights:

- **Efficiency & Scalability:** The Firebase Studio prototyper has proven to be highly efficient, capable of generating features for large-scale applications. It effectively utilizes a wide array of boilerplate architectures and patterns, particularly for Next.js development.
- **Integration Capabilities:** Many complex integrations were successfully implemented through simple verbal commands within the Prototyper environment, highlighting its powerful AI capabilities.
- **Pair Programming Limitations:** A current limitation is the inability to conduct traditional pair programming, as the workspace supports only one prompt session at a time.
    - **Recommendation:** We recommend adopting a shift-based approach, where one individual focuses on development while another handles testing.
- **Code Replication for Testing:** To facilitate robust testing, it is recommended to replicate the codebase to a separate project workspace.
    - **Important Note:** It's crucial to understand that the prototyper functionality is **not available** in project workspaces created based on existing GitHub repositories. Therefore, testing workspaces should be established independently.
- **Integration development:** . Integrations and backend functions was not succesful using Firebase Studio Prototyper. We ended up building separate project for backend. Stack chosen for backend was Java. Firebase Studio and Gemini code assist was not useful in the development of backend.
    - **Recommendation:** Utilize external tool like Claude on desktop to develop Cloud Function on desktop. Claude impressions: TODO@Mohamed . Senior backend developer is needed still for app project to configure and develop backend features.
## 5. Key Project File Snippets

- **`README.md` (Excerpt):**
    ```

    # Firebase Studio

    This is a NextJS starter template for building applications with Firebase Studio.

    To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.
    ```
    *This snippet indicates the project's foundation as a Next.js template generated by Firebase Studio.*

- **`apphosting.yaml` (Excerpt):**
    ```
    runConfig:
      maxInstances: 1
    ```
    *This configuration file outlines settings for Firebase App Hosting, with `maxInstances: 1` as a default setting for scaling.*

- **`public/docs/project-history.md` (Excerpt):**
    ```
    - **Data & File Handling**: The workflow uses client-side session storage to persist form data between steps and uploads all documents to a temporary location in Firebase Storage, moving them to a permanent user-specific folder upon final submission.
    ```
    *This highlights the project's approach to data persistence and document management using Firebase Storage.*
