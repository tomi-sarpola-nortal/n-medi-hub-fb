# Project History & Feature Summary

This document outlines the features and changes implemented in the Dental Chamber Portal project in chronological order.

### 1. Initial Project Scaffolding & I18n
- **Internationalization (i18n)**: The project was set up with support for English (`en`) and German (`de`) languages from the start, utilizing `next-intl` for routing and translations.
- **Core Layout**: A standard application layout was established, including a main content area, a sidebar for navigation, and a header.
- **Authentication**: A complete authentication flow was built, including login, registration, and session management using Firebase.

### 2. Multi-Step Registration Workflow
- **Step-by-Step Process**: A comprehensive, multi-step registration process was implemented for new dentists, guiding them through:
    1.  Account Creation (Email & Password)
    2.  Personal Data Entry
    3.  Professional Qualifications
    4.  Practice Information
    5.  Final Review & Submission
- **File Uploads**: Functionality was added to allow users to upload necessary documents (ID, diplomas, etc.) during registration, which are securely stored in Firebase Storage.
- **Data Persistence**: A temporary client-side store was implemented to persist form data between registration steps.

### 3. Core Application Features & Pages
- **Role-Based Dashboards**: Separate dashboard views were created for `dentist` and `lk_member` roles, displaying relevant information and actions for each.
- **Education/Trainings Page**: A page was developed for dentists to view their continuing education points, including progress toward ZFD and Specialist Diplomas, and a detailed training history table.
- **Member Overview (LK Member)**: A feature was built for Chamber Members to view, search, and filter a list of all dentists. It includes a section to review pending applications.
- **Member Detail & Review Pages**: Chamber Members can view a detailed profile for each dentist and access a specific review page to approve or reject pending applications or data changes.

### 4. "My Representations" Module
- **Separated Tables**: The "My Representations" page was refactored to use two distinct tables for clarity: one for "Representations Received" and another for "Representations Performed".
- **Confirmation Flow**: A dedicated card was added for dentists to easily confirm or decline pending representation requests from other dentists.
- **"New Representation" Workflow**: The form for adding a new representation was enhanced with several UX improvements:
    - **Searchable Dentist Selection**: A pop-up dialog was created, allowing users to search for dentists by name or ID.
    - **"Previously Represented" List**: A "quick select" list was added, showing recently represented dentists to speed up form entry.

### 5. UI/UX Refinements
- **Standardized Profile Icon**: The user avatar in the sidebar was changed to a standard `UserCircle` icon for a more consistent UI.
- **Dashboard Card Fix**: The "Your State Chamber" info card was updated to ensure long text (like email addresses) wraps correctly and does not overflow.
- **Documents Page Search**: A search input was added to the "Document Templates" page, enabling users to filter documents by title or publisher.

### 6. Developer & Project Documentation
- **Developer Module**: A dedicated page was created for development and testing tools, including database seeders.
- **History Documentation**: Project and prompt history files were created and organized into a `/public/docs/` directory. The Developer Module page was updated with buttons to correctly link to these files.
