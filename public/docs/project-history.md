# Project Development History

This document outlines the features and changes implemented during the development session.

## Core UI & Layout
- **Sidebar Enhancements**:
  - The user profile section in the sidebar is now a clickable link that navigates to the `/settings` page.
  - The user's avatar was updated to use a standard `UserCircle` icon for a consistent look.
- **Dashboard UI Fix**:
  - Corrected a text-wrapping issue on the "Your State Chamber" information card to prevent long email addresses from overflowing.

## Representations Module
- **Representations Overview Page**:
  - The main table was split into two distinct tables: one for "Representations Received" and another for "Representations Performed".
  - The "Enter New Representation" button was logically moved to the header of the "Performed" table.
- **New Representation Page**:
  - **Dentist Selection**: Replaced the initial combobox with a more user-friendly dialog popup. This dialog allows searching for dentists by name or ID.
  - **Form Simplification**: Removed the "Calculated Duration" field to streamline the form.
  - **Time Input**:
    - Default start and end times are now set to 11:00 AM and 12:00 PM respectively.
    - Time inputs were updated to use separate dropdowns for hours and 15-minute intervals for minutes (00, 15, 30, 45).
  - **Quick Select Feature**: Added a "Previously Represented" list on the right side of the form. Clicking a name from this list populates the main form's "Represented Dentist" field, speeding up data entry.
- **Bug Fixes**:
  - Resolved a race condition where clicking on a dentist in the selection list would not register due to the component unmounting too quickly.
  - Fixed a runtime error caused by a missing `Label` component import.

## Documents Module
- **Search Functionality**:
  - Implemented a search bar on the Documents page. Users can now filter the document list in real-time by searching for a document's title or publisher.

## Member Management Module
- **Member Detail Page**:
  - Activated and implemented the "Trainings" tab to display the selected member's complete training history.
  - Activated and implemented the "Representations" tab to display a full history of representations performed by or for the selected member.
