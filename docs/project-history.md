# Project History & Feature Summary

This document outlines the features and changes implemented in the Dental Chamber Portal project in chronological order.

---

### 1. Initial Setup & Core Layout
- **Project Initialization**: The project started as a standard Next.js application with TypeScript, ShadCN UI, and Tailwind CSS.
- **Firebase Integration**: Firebase was configured and integrated to handle backend services like authentication, Firestore database, and storage. An authentication context (`AuthContext`) was created to manage user sessions across the application.
- **Core Layout & Navigation**: A primary application layout was built, featuring a persistent sidebar for navigation and a header. The initial structure for role-based navigation was defined in `src/config/nav.ts`.

### 2. Authentication & Registration
- **Login Page**: A login page was created with email and password fields, including basic validation and error handling that links to the authentication context.
- **Multi-Step Registration Workflow**: A comprehensive, step-by-step registration process was implemented for new dentists, guiding them through:
    1.  **Account Creation**: Email validation and password setup.
    2.  **Personal Data**: Collecting user details and an ID document upload.
    3.  **Professional Qualifications**: Gathering educational and professional credentials with multiple document uploads.
    4.  **Practice Information**: Input for clinic details.
    5.  **Final Review**: A summary page for the user to review all entered data.
    6.  **Success Page**: A confirmation screen after successful submission.
- **Data & File Handling**: The workflow uses client-side session storage to persist form data between steps and uploads all documents to a temporary location in Firebase Storage, moving them to a permanent user-specific folder upon final submission.

### 3. Role-Based Functionality
- **Dashboards**: Separate, tailored dashboard views were created for `dentist` and `lk_member` roles, presenting the most relevant information and actions for each user type. This includes training progress for dentists and pending member reviews for chamber members.
- **Member Management (LK Member)**:
    - An overview page was built for Chamber Members to view, search, and filter all registered members.
    - A member detail page was created with a tabbed interface to display comprehensive user data, including their training history and representations.
    - A dedicated review page was implemented, allowing chamber members to approve, deny, or reject new member registrations or data changes.

### 4. Application Modules
- **Document Templates**: A page was developed for users to browse, filter, and download documents. For chamber members, this page includes functionality to upload new templates and delete existing ones. Search functionality was added to filter documents by title or publisher.
- **Education/Trainings Page**: A page was created for dentists to view their continuing education status, including progress visualizations for ZFD points and a detailed, sortable history of their completed training.
- **"My Representations" Module**: This page was built to manage peer representations. It was enhanced through several iterations:
    - **Initial Version**: A single table to show all representations.
    - **Refactor for Clarity**: The page was split into two distinct tables: one for "Representations Received" and another for "Representations Performed".
    - **Dedicated Confirmation**: A prominent card was added for dentists to easily confirm or decline pending requests.
    - **Enhanced "New Representation" Form**: The form was improved by replacing a simple dropdown with a searchable pop-up dialog and adding a "Previously Represented" list for quick selection.

### 5. UI/UX & Documentation
- **UI Refinements**: Various UI/UX improvements were made, including standardizing the user avatar to an icon and fixing text wrapping on dashboard cards.
- **Developer Module**: A dedicated page was created for development tools, including database seeders and links to project documentation.
- **Project Documentation**: This project history file and a detailed prompt history log were created and organized into the `/public/docs/` directory to document the development process.
